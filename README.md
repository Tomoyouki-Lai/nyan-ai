## 🌟 What is Nyan AI?

**Nyan AI** is a new kind of AI web automation platform that combines **anime-style assistant characters**, a **shareable script system (Nyan Cards)**, and a **community-first approach**. No coding required — users can view, run, and share web agent tasks with ease.

Unlike traditional Web Agents, Nyan AI is not just about automation — it's about communication, growth, and community.

## ⚠️ Notes on Chrome Extension and AI Features

- If the extension stays idle on a webpage for too long, please reload the page to ensure smooth operation.  
- When you first enter a webpage, if there is no user interaction, the browser may block automatic sound playback, preventing immediate audio activation.  
- The AI takes longer to initialize on its first startup.  
- Each Large Language Model (LLM) has its own personality and behavior; the same Nyan character may react differently depending on the LLM used.
