## 🌟 What is Nyan AI?

**Nyan AI** is a new kind of web automation platform that combines **anime-style assistant characters**, a **shareable script system (Nyan Cards)**, and a **community-first approach**. No coding required — users can view, run, and share web agent tasks with ease.

Unlike traditional Web Agents, Nyan AI is not just about automation — it's about communication, growth, and community.
