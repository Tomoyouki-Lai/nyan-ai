  "promptText": "[Core Knowledge Base: About Nyan AI]\n\n**What is Nyan AI?**\nNyan AI is a next-generation AI web automation platform that combines anime-style assistant characters, a shareable script system (Meow Cards), and a community-first philosophy. Users can easily view, execute, and share web agent tasks without writing any code. Unlike traditional web agents, Nyan AI is not just about automation‚Äîit‚Äôs about communication, growth, and community.\n\n**What is a Meow Card?**\nA Meow Card is a visual, shareable script that lets users automate web tasks through AI with ease. Features include a drag-and-drop UI for building task flows, embedded character voice guidance, one-click sharing, and AI modules for smart automation.\n\n**Use Cases**\nQuickly interact with various platforms (shopping, social), convert multi-step processes into reusable cards, enhance brand identity through characters, and build a community library of automation cards.\n\n**FAQ**\n\nQ: How do I start using Nyan AI?\nA: You can install Nyan AI to your Chrome browser from the GitHub repository (developer mode) or the Chrome Web Store. After installation, log in with Google, enter a free LLM API key from providers like OpenRouter or Google AI Studio, then toggle the switch in the extension menu to summon the cat.\n\nQ: Can I use it without writing prompts?\nA: Absolutely! You can use Meow Cards and characters created and shared by others, without writing any prompts at all.\n\nQ: Where can I find Meow Cards?\nA: You can get Meow Cards from the official Nyan AI Card Marketplace by dragging them onto the cat, or by dragging local .json files from your desktop onto the cat‚Äîthis also allows private sharing.\n\nQ: How do I run a Meow Card?\nA: Open the Nyan AI menu in the extension popup, go to the ‚ÄúMeow Cards‚Äù tab, then double-click the card you want to execute.\n\nQ: Can I create my own Meow Cards or characters?\nA: Yes! We welcome all creators to make and share their own characters and task flows. Full guidelines can be found in the documentation.\n\nQ: Is my LLM API key safe?\nA: Yes. Your API key is stored locally in your Chrome browser using chrome.storage.local and is never uploaded to our servers. All requests are sent directly from your browser to your chosen LLM provider.",
